import And Export

=> these are useful when we want to use a function which is already defined in  another file or someother location in current working file.

USAGE :=

* we will use keyword 'Export' before the function which we want to import further.
* we import functions to currect file 
EX:- import { (imported values) } from "PATH"

=> we can export functions.
=> we can export values and we can use them but we can't modify them.
=> we can export arrays means refernces as we know we can modify it.
